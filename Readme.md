## Thousands (or more) of automated dash.js clients.


Three ways to run automated dash.js clients using headless google chrome:
1. bash script on localhost
1. terraform for AWS EC2 instances
1. javascript node.js with puppeteer and docker (work in progress)

Also included is a player that uses the dash.js client from 
[this qualabs repo](https://github.com/montevideo-tech/cmcd-analyzer/tree/feature/cmcd-v2-demuxed/analyzer-dashboard/public), 
which has some support for CMCDv2.
